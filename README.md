This  project focuses on the development of a smart agricultural system that harnesses the power of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide farmers with precise and valuable crop management recommendations. The aim is to assist farmers in making informed decisions that can enhance crop yields, reduce costs, and promote sustainable practices. The system encompasses various components including crop recommendation, plant disease identification, weed detection, and optimized fertilizer application.
Traditionally, farmers have relied on their expertise and experience to make farming decisions. However, with the advent of AI and machine learning, farmers are increasingly leveraging these technologies to augment their decision-making processes. Nevertheless, many existing models operate as "black boxes," meaning that it is challenging to understand the insights gained from the data or the underlying factors influencing predictions.
To address this issue, this project incorporates an emerging field of artificial intelligence known as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and interpretative machine learning. The system explores the utility of several XAI methods by training and applying them to agricultural datasets. This approach allows for the extraction of meaningful insights and explanations from the models, enabling farmers to make more informed choices based on real-time data. By providing transparent and interpretable recommendations, the system empowers farmers to optimize crop production efficiently. The integration of XAI methods within the smart agricultural system holds great promise. It allows farmers to not only receive accurate recommendations but also comprehend the reasoning behind those recommendations. This transparency fosters trust and confidence in the system, making it more likely for farmers to adopt and implement its suggestions.
